# Whats new -1-
I added a node server and uploaded the database on mongodb atlas. I also made the database of 1000 items. the app now works locally with the server

# Whats new -2- 
- the front end is deployed on vercel https://wellplates.vercel.app/ 
- the server is deployed on vercel https://wellplates-server.vercel.app/api/
- ! i am having a uri change, so depending on when you access the website, it might not open (thing is uri is dependent on password, i changed the old password and waiting for the change to be reflected onn mongodb atlas side for the uri 
inn other words, the uri is dependent on my currennt password. despite the fact that i changed the password, uri is only working on the old password

)
# What i am currently focusing on:
- writing instructions onn how to run the app locally
- code refactoring 
- JSDoc


# Next step, not in a specific order:
- admin portal ? 
- helper bot
- sorting, which will lead to a more extensive filtering (for example number of wells between 24 and 384)
- compare wellplates
- more user friendly
- allowing users to add wellplates
- images and 3d model will also be delivered from somewhere else
