# Wellplates 
information about the project in /docs.

features so far:

**Search Functionality**: Easily search for wellplates using a search bar.

**Filtering Options**: Filter wellplates by material, brand, and number of wells.

**Detailed Views**: View detailed information about each wellplate, including images and 3D models.

**Fullscreen Mode**: View images and 3D models in fullscreen.

What i am currently focus my work on:
- Usage of a server and hosting the database on mongodb
- JSDoc for the whole project


some features i'm thinking about implementing once i'm done, not in a specific order:
- admin portal ? 
- some sort of helper bot
- sorting, which will lead to a more extensive filtering (for example number of wells between 24 and 384)
- compare wellplates
- more user friendly
- - allowing users to add wellplates
