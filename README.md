# Whats new -1-
I added a node server and uploaded the database on mongodb atlas. I also made the database of 1000 items. the app now works locally with the server

# Whats new -2- 
- database of 108 wellplates (not real)
- the front end is deployed on vercel https://wellplates.vercel.app/ 
- the server is deployed on vercel https://wellplates-server.vercel.app/api/
- ! i am having a uri change, so depending on when you access the website, it might not open 
(the uri is dependent on my current password. despite the fact that i changed the password, uri is only working on the old password at the moment)


# What i am currently focusing on:
- writing instructions onn how to run the app locally
- code refactoring 
- JSDoc


# Next step, not in a specific order:
- remove the uri leak from github
- be able to refresh the page 
- admin portal ? 
- helper bot
- sorting, which will lead to a more extensive filtering (for example number of wells between 24 and 384)
- compare wellplates
- more user friendly
- allowing users to add wellplates
- images and 3d model will also be delivered from somewhere else
