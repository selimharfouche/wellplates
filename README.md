information about the project in /docs.

features so far:
**Search Functionality**: Easily search for wellplates using a search bar.
**Filtering Options**: Filter wellplates by material, brand, and number of wells.
**Detailed Views**: View detailed information about each wellplate, including images and 3D models.
**Fullscreen Mode**: View images and 3D models in fullscreen.

to do :
- comment the code annd refactore it to ensure scalabality and to be able to add features in an organized way
- update the README in /docs


some features i'm thinking about implementing once i'm done, not in a specific order:
- some sort of helper bot
- allow users to add/modify wellplates (will lead to adding fields in the database such as date of entry, modification etc... ), cann be via github or via a regular sign in ...
- sorting, which will lead to a more extensive filtering (for example number of wells between 24 and 384)
- compare wellplates
- more user friendly
