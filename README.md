# Whats new - 1
I added a node server and uploaded the database on mongodb atlas. I also made the database of 1000 items. the app now works locally with the server

# What i am currently focus my work on:
- deploy the new app (that includes the server)
- code refactoring 
- JSDoc


# Next step, not in a specific order:
- admin portal ? 
- helper bot
- sorting, which will lead to a more extensive filtering (for example number of wells between 24 and 384)
- compare wellplates
- more user friendly
- allowing users to add wellplates
- images and 3d model will also be delivered from somewhere else
