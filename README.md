# Whats new -1-
I added a node server and uploaded the database on mongodb atlas. I also made the database of 1000 items. the app now works locally with the server

# Whats new -2- 
- database of 108 wellplates (not real)
- the front end is deployed on vercel https://wellplates.vercel.app/ 
- the server is deployed on vercel https://wellplates-server.vercel.app/api/

# What i am currently focusing on:
- writing instructions on how to run the app locally -> docs/README.MD
- code refactoring 
- documentaion, JSDoc


# Next step, not in a specific order:
- Mozilla sops
- npmjs secure-env
- be able to refresh the page 
- admin portal ? 
- helper bot
- sorting, which will lead to a more extensive filtering (for example number of wells between 24 and 384)
- compare wellplates
- more user friendly
- allowing users to add wellplates
- images and 3d model will also be delivered from somewhere else
