# App Component

## Overview

The `App.js` file sets up the main structure of the React application, including the router and routes. It imports necessary components and data, and defines the main `App` component that wraps everything within a router context and sets up the navigation.

## Code

```javascript
// App.js

// Summary:
// This file sets up the main structure of the React application, including the router and routes.
// It imports necessary components and data, and defines the main App component that wraps everything
// within a router context and sets up the navigation.

// Includes
import React from 'react'; // Importing React library
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'; // Importing components from react-router-dom for routing
import './App.css'; // Importing the CSS file for styling
import data from './data/database.json'; // Importing the JSON data
import Search from './components/Search'; // Importing the Search component
import ItemDetail from './components/ItemDetail'; // Importing the ItemDetail component

// App Component
/**
 * The main App component that sets up the router and routes.
 */
function App() {
  return (
    // Wrapping the entire application in a Router context for routing
    <Router>
      {/* Main container for the App component */}
      <div className="App">
        {/* Header section of the App */}
        <header className="App-header">
          {/* Main title of the application */}
          <h1>Search App</h1>
          {/* Routes container defining the different routes in the app */}
          <Routes>
            {/* Route for the home page displaying the Search component */}
            <Route path="/" element={<Search data={data.wellplates} />} />
            {/*
            This Route component defines a dynamic route for the application using react-router-dom.

            - path="/item/:name":
                - The 'path' attribute specifies the URL pattern for this route.
                - '/item/:name' is a dynamic path where ':name' is a URL parameter.
                - ':name' acts as a placeholder that will capture part of the URL and pass it to the component as a prop.
                - For example, a URL like '/item/Standard%2096-Well%20Plate' will match this route.

            - element={<ItemDetail data={data.wellplates} />}:
                - The 'element' attribute specifies the React component to render when the URL matches the defined path.
                - In this case, the ItemDetail component is rendered.
                - The ItemDetail component is passed a prop 'data' which contains the wellplates data from the imported JSON file (data.wellplates).
                - This wellplates data is used by the ItemDetail component to display detailed information about the selected wellplate.

            How it works:
            - When the user navigates to a URL matching the pattern '/item/:name', this route is activated.
            - The ':name' part of the URL (e.g., 'Standard 96-Well Plate') is extracted and made available to the ItemDetail component via the useParams hook.
            - The ItemDetail component can then use this parameter to find the corresponding wellplate data in the 'data' prop and display the details.

            Example scenario:
            - User clicks on a link generated by the Search component which points to '/item/Standard%2096-Well%20Plate'.
            - The router matches this URL to the defined path '/item/:name'.
            - The ItemDetail component is rendered with the wellplates data passed as a prop.
            - The ':name' parameter is extracted as 'Standard 96-Well Plate' and used to find and display the relevant wellplate details in the ItemDetail component.

            <Route path="/item/:name" element={<ItemDetail data={data.wellplates} />} />
          </Routes>
        </header>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
